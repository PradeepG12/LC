anchester -> parent nodes (e.g. for 4 -> 2, 1 are anchester) 
      1
    2   3
  4       5

full binary tree = all children should have either 0 or 2

complete binary tree = all levels should completely filled or else left level should filled
e.g.   
       1
    2     3
   4 5   5

perfect binary tree = all levels are equal
degenerated tree = every node has same side nodes  left>>left
